Hired as an additional Code Reviewer (alongside Gaff) as the codebase grew to 9 crates with many concurrent workstreams. Project: onnx-genai, a Rust ONNX Runtime generative-AI inference runtime. Focus: correctness/safety gates on decode, sampling, KV, concurrency, and API contracts. Strict reviewer-lockout semantics apply on rejection. Validate green with real exit codes; never approve on style alone.

- Reviewed Batty's issue #14 vision token-expansion wiring and rejected multi-image over-count plus missing `tokens_per_tile` guards; Batty was locked out and Leon owned the fix.
