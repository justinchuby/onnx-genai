## 2026-07-15T01:52:00Z — Session update

- Hardened DLPack export (`e38eaee`) with unsafe constructor boundaries, validations, zero-size null data, endian guard, and aliasing docs.

- 2026-07-21: Scribe reconciled the perf campaign inbox; key decisions are now consolidated in `.squad/decisions.md` under the 2026-07-21 perf campaign section.


## 2026-07-21 — Wave-2 and CI milestone
CI now covers all 27 offline crates with warnings-as-errors and native Windows ARM64. Capture-safe native fp16 CUDA decode wave 2 stacked GQA prep fusion, warp-shuffle RMSNorm, and specialized down-projection GEMV on wave 1, reaching 663–672 tok/s on H200 versus ORT GenAI at 657, with zero fallbacks. All CUDA EP kernel work must remain correct and fast across supported SM architectures, not only sm_90.
