# Leon — History

## Role and invariants
Engine/KV/runtime-buffer implementer. Runtime owns KV; model geometry comes from `inference_metadata.yaml`, not ORT-GenAI configuration. Preserve device-buffer ownership, past/present aliasing contracts, exact real-model comparison settings, and reviewer lockouts.

## Summary through 2026-07-14T20:05:00Z

### Engine and KV
Implemented attention-sink SWA, SharedKv generalization, connector engine wiring, and real KV byte materialization. Prefix lookup initially remained metric-only until K4 added symmetric f32 payload extraction/injection. Prefix-dependent hashing now proves equal keys imply equal prefixes. Follow-ups remain for multi-layer fixtures, graceful recompute fallback, and heterogeneous connector payloads.

### Gemma4 speculative execution
Migrated engine paths to per-layer KV geometry and helped deliver real heterogeneous Gemma4 E2B execution. Corrected proposer inputs to `embed(last_token) + last_hidden`, raising acceptance from 25% to 70.6% with token identity preserved. Performance remains below greedy and is a separate tuning concern.

### Loader dtype and fusion hardening
Closed silent Float32 fallbacks with `UnsupportedDataType` and fail-closed decoding across all real dtype sites; Holden approved. Added strict LayerNorm operand-order guards and adversarial coverage; Gaff approved.

### EPContext and encoder
Rejected encoder v1 for generic-layer EPContext literals violating the model-agnostic rule; Deckard's v2 passed. Revised EPContext writer sidecar naming after Batty's rejection, but introduced an over-broad duplicate-identity rejection; Leon is locked out of that writer artifact and Gaff's v3 is final. Later unified external-path guarding and explicit C API mapping were approved.

### Product/API and packaging
Renamed the full C ABI from `ort2_*` to `nxrt_*` with no compatibility aliases. Broke the shape-inference/loader publication cycle by making the loader dev-dependency path-only in the packaged manifest; Roy approved.

### Recent validation
Loader opset-import validation for file, from-parts, and nested-subgraph paths merged in `00cda89`; the executor's sentinel failure path is now an unreachable invariant. Holden's final review was green.

- 2026-07-15 — Added Windows oneDNN wheel bundling in `ef89a95`; CI verification is pending.

- 2026-07-16T00:00:01Z — Re-profiled native CPU decode after MatMulNBits threading and landed allocation-free, same-shape contiguous-f32 `Mul` (`347060f`). The guarded non-aliased fast path reduced Mul 3.12→0.25 ms and decode 40.5→44.2 tok/s; Holden 🟡 approved (independent +6.35%).

- 2026-07-16T00:00:00Z — Streamlined M=1 GQA decode to write contiguous f32 attention and present K/V outputs directly (`1fdd1ec`), preserving the generic prefill/strided/non-f32 path. GQA fell 0.865→0.690 ms/step and decode rose 54.38→58.44 tok/s (+7.5%) with exact eight-token output; Sebastian cleared the change and 413 CPU EP tests pass.

- 2026-07-16T00:00:00Z — Repaired the rejected CUDA executor control-flow paths in `5c0f05f` under Deckard's lockout. Non-host SequenceAt values now synchronously upload to correctly stamped CUDA buffers; Scan retains host staging and relies on child-executor H2D. Added CUDA SequenceAt/Scan versus CPU parity coverage; Holden cleared the repair, with exact Qwen tokens, session 112/112, and CUDA EP 117/117.

## 2026-07-16T15:39:27Z — Scribe session update

- 🟢 Reviewed BlockQuantizedMatMul: hand-verified MXFP4 0xD7→12.0/-6.0 and IQ4_NL decoding; unsupported IQ formats fail closed and 420 CPU tests pass.

## 2026-07-16T18:11:48+0000 — IQ-family CPU decode reviews

- 🟢 Cleared Bryant's IQ2_XS/IQ2_S/IQ3_XXS and IQ1_S/IQ1_M implementations after upstream llama.cpp grid, layout, fingerprint, and hand-trace audits.
- CPU `BlockQuantizedMatMul` now covers the complete supported IQ family.

## 2026-07-16T19:05:18+0000 — BlockQuantizedMatMul prefill review

- 🟢 Cleared Joi's `5010261`: all ten formats matched scalar decode bits, selected MXFP4/IQ4_NL/IQ4_XS AVX2 paths were independently checked, and generic GEMM retained K accumulation order.
- Default and oneDNN CPU EP suites each passed 430 tests; M=64 generic matmul gains measured 32–35×.

## 2026-07-16T19:27:57+0000 — CUDA IQ super-block GEMV wave

- 🟢 Cleared Roy's shared `onnx-runtime-quantization` extraction: all seven moved grids/sign tables are byte-identical (IQ1S FNV-1a `0x6703ed863501ae2e`); CPU decode and Joi's AVX2 paths are unchanged, and the standalone crate builds/tests cleanly.
