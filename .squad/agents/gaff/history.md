- **Joined:** 2026-07-12

## 2026-07-12T13:14:00-07:00 — Engine quality review merged
Gaff's review is now in decisions: engine.rs is a ~3,300-line god module. Refactor toward shared decode loop, module split, DecodeBackend, Sampler, proposer/verifier seams, and targeted tests.


## 2026-07-13T18:30:00Z — Review/fix batch
- Reviewed Zhora debug/queue-depth and Sapper token-expansion. Rejected Zhora's unauthenticated `/v1/debug/*` session-ID exposure and flagged Sapper thumbnail ordering; lockout fixes moved to Rachael and Deckard.

## 2026-07-14T02:37:00Z — Reviewed ort2-loader + loader-weights
- **ort2-loader (7e0e367):** 🟡 — ONNX→IR pipeline, protox build, mmap weights, shape inference.
- **loader-weights (dd5297d):** 🟡 — WeightStore re-export, norm_axis fix.

## 2026-07-14T05:04:00Z — ORT2 review: loader const-fold-lite shape inference

- **squad/ort2-loader-shapeinfer** review (🟢 SHIP): No wrong constant found — every fold aborts via `?`/`None` on unknown/non-integer operands; symbolic operands degrade to fresh symbols; bounds enforced at all entry points. `bert_toy_optimized_every_value_resolves` ran on real model (257 KB, not skipped) — passed. All 27/27 tests green. Advisories: A1 `Div` truncation vs floor for negative operands (no positive-dim impact); A2 `Shape` of unresolved input folds to rank-0 (pre-existing).

## 2026-07-14T07:20:00Z — ORT2 shape-inference crate review

- **gaff-6:** Reviewed `onnx-runtime-shape-inference` registry dispatch, topo driver, shape-data side-table, and public API. 🟢 APPROVE. Ran 4 integrity probes: registry opset boundaries correct, driver transactional (no half-annotated state on error), shape-data per-call HashMap (no stale leakage), API minimal and panic-free. IR contract NOT modified — zero lines changed in `onnx-runtime-ir`. Roy not locked out.

## 2026-07-14T10:00:00Z — ORT2 fused-domain dispatch review (gaff-7)

- **Task:** Review Batty's fused-op contrib domain change on `squad/ort2-fused-domain` (`1e894de`). Verify dispatch/registry soundness.
- **Verdict:** 🟢 GREEN — dispatch set correct, normalization symmetric, no phantom kernel registration.
- **Key checks:** Provider gate accept set == registered (op_type, domain) pairs exactly; default-domain == PHASE1_OPS 1:1; len invariant holds. ai.onnx→"" normalization symmetric in both `lookup` and `supports`. Contrib opset u64::MAX → resolves v1, no panic. Dual-domain LayerNorm: distinct OpKey entries, no cross-domain resolution. FusedMatMulBias/FusedGemm: supports()=false in both domains → rejected at placement. Debug+release all green; bert_toy PASS max_abs 1.192e-7; clippy clean.

## 2026-07-14T11:40:00Z — Review: ORT2 fusion-executable FusedMatMulBias (gaff-8)

- **Reviewed:** `squad/ort2-fusion-executable` @ `0f4811e` (author: Batty).
- **Scope:** FusedMatMulBias kernel numerics, shape rule, registry/dispatch, MatMul+Add operand-order generality.
- **Verdict:** 🟡 Approve with required follow-up.
- **Key confirmed:** Kernel numerics correct ✅; `matmul_dense` extraction no regression ✅; shape rule consistent ✅; registry/dispatch consistent ✅; operand-order ROBUST (not baked to bert_toy) ✅.
- **Gap (G1):** MatMul+Add fusion has no shape guard — silent-wrong when bias operand would expand matmul output. Owner: Roy/Deckard (Batty locked out).

## 2026-07-14T14:35:00Z — gaff-10: Reviewed leon-11 (LayerNorm order guard) + roy-17 (EPContext loader)

**gaff-10a — Leon LayerNorm order guard:** 🟢 APPROVE. Guard structural/model-agnostic; non-tautological positive + adversarial coverage; drift and reference bounds separate; 31→33 tests; debug+release+clippy green.

**gaff-10b — Roy EPContext loader LOAD path:** 🟢 APPROVE. Opaque blob preservation byte-for-exact-byte (scoped to `is_ep_context_op && ep_cache_context` only); path-safety rejects before join; mmap unsafe follows weights.rs idiom; 7/7 epcontext + 15/15 loader tests green; clippy clean.

## 2026-07-14T16:20:00Z — onnx-encoder v1 review (gaff-11)
Reviewed Roy's ONNX encoder v1 (`9ffd65c`). 🟢 GREEN — round-trip fidelity and prost encoding correct for Phase-1/2 scope. Real BERT fixture (257 KB) byte-exact. 4 non-blocking advisories: A1 subgraph formal I/O silently omitted (recommend guard), A2 model metadata silently defaulted, A3 STRING byte-exact doc nuance, A4 external re-inlining bloat. Did not identify the §55.6 model-agnostic violation (found by Leon). Not locked out.

## 2026-07-14T16:45:00Z — gaff-12: Review EPContext §55.4 writer v1 (batty-16)

- **Reviewed:** `squad/ort2-epctx-writer` @ `7eb30ff` (author: Batty). Scope: round-trip fidelity + path/security safety.
- **Verdict:** 🟢 GREEN — byte-exact both modes; sidecar sanitizer resists path traversal. No blocking findings.
- **Confirmed**: embed non-UTF-8 byte-exact; external sidecar verbatim write+mmap; hostile inputs (traversal sequences, NUL, `\`) all sanitized to in-directory filenames; node boundary `X→EPContext→Y` preserved.
- **Advisory A**: sidecar collision on duplicate sanitized (source, partition_name) — suggested index disambiguator. **Advisory B**: sanitizer test covers only `/`.
- Reproduced: loader 15+3 ok; session 10 ok.

## 2026-07-14T17:50:00Z — gaff-13: EPContext §55.4 writer v3 (revision owner, deckard-18 named)

- **Task:** Fix deckard-18's 🔴 blocking regression — remove over-broad `(source, partition_name)` duplicate-primary rejection from leon-14 v2. Batty and Leon locked out.
- **Change:** Deleted blanket `HashSet<(&str, &str)>` guard in `dump_ep_context`; updated `# Errors` doc-comment; deleted `duplicate_partition_identity_is_rejected` test.
- **Added:** `duplicate_primary_identity_round_trips_external` — two same-source/same-(empty)-name primaries, distinct non-UTF-8 blobs, external mode → `m_ctx_p0_EpA.bin`/`m_ctx_p1_EpA.bin` distinct; each reloaded byte-exact.
- **Kept intact:** B1 injective `_p{index}_` sidecar names; A1 enable-gating; A2 NodeId seam doc; sanitizer test.
- **Commit:** `0fa025e` (= `6e65e85`). **deckard-19 🟢 APPROVE.** Final merged commit on main.

## 2026-07-14T18:55:00Z — gaff-14: Review EPContext §55.5 capi FFI + e2e round-trip (chew-25)

Non-author review of `squad/ort2-epctx-options` @ `3e8dbde`. Scope: capi FFI memory safety + e2e correctness.

- Audited four new capi entry points: null handling PASS, invalid UTF-8 PASS, ownership/lifetime PASS (borrow-not-consume), panics across FFI PASS (all in `guard`).
- E2e: byte-exact non-UTF-8 round-trip via mock EP confirmed; disabled path writes nothing confirmed.
- **Verdict: 🟢 GREEN** — 2 non-blocking advisories:
  - A1: No negative FFI tests for null/invalid-UTF-8 into `ort2_add_session_config_entry` (coverage gap only).
  - A2: Released-handle reuse unguarded — by design, matches existing opaque-handle contract.

## 2026-07-14T13:55:00Z — gaff-15: Review — external-data path-traversal guard (deckard-21)

Security review of `weights.rs` traversal guard (commit `340d7b0`). Audited all untrusted-path-to-mmap sites in the loader (2 total, both now guarded); verified lexical correctness via throwaway probe; checked TOCTOU, capi wildcard, test quality. **Verdict: 🟡 YELLOW approve.** 3 non-blocking advisories: (1) lexical-only/symlinks — accepted, parity with epcontext; (2) capi `ExternalDataPath → InvalidGraph` explicit arm; (3) DRY — `resolve_external_path` duplicated in `weights.rs`/`epcontext.rs`. Build + clippy + conformance all green.

## 2026-07-14T14:50:00Z — gaff-16: Review — nxrt C-ABI symbol rename (leon-16)

Non-author review of Leon's `ort2_*` → `nxrt_*` C-ABI rename. Verified both files become byte-identical to their parents when `nxrt_` normalized back to `ort2_`; zero `ort2_` remaining in `crates/`; preserved legacy text limited to unchanged citations and intentional label strings; no alias shims or dangling intra-doc links. Eight-crate build + 17 capi tests + rustdoc: all PASS. **Verdict: 🟢 GREEN.**

- 2026-07-14T19:05:00Z — UnsupportedOp enrichment was rejected because `u64::MAX` leaked as a user-facing opset. Useful node/domain/EP context survived; missing imports are now rejected during loading by Leon's merged validation.

- 2026-07-15 — Reviewed Mariette’s cpuinfo publish fix; approved (`65cc851`).
- 2026-07-19: Reviewed PR #30 through four cycles and verified the rebased integration before merge.
- 2026-07-19T07:55:00Z: PR #30's reviewed sampler and retry-safety integration remained intact through the subsequent EP-capabilities landing.

## 2026-07-19T07:42:20Z — Mobius-head E2E harness review

- Approved Leon's pinned GLM/DeepSeek harness; immutable manifest pins, clean missing-artifact skips, and real `Engine::from_dir` execution for present artifacts were verified. Landed as `3d47ea9`.

## 2026-07-19T13:10Z — cudarc CUDA-version unification review
Reviewed Deckard's fix for the cudarc CUDA-version-feature conflict. Verified all three builds plus `onnx-runtime-ep-cuda` tests, confirmed Cargo 1.97 rejects `{ workspace = true, default-features = false }`, and approved the inline path+version dependency choice.


- **2026-07-19T16:15:00Z — Conformance review:** Approved the 936/829/1765 conformance refresh with non-blocking attribution nits; artifacts landed as `4c05ede`.


## 2026-07-19T18:20:00Z — CPU-EP op coverage 936→975

- Rejected initial BitShift/OneHot/Compress, approved Sapper’s fix (`49d8827`), and approved the 975 conformance refresh (`eef2c81`).

- 2026-07-19: Approved ConvTranspose. Rejected unmatched-thread benchmark comparisons, then approved Pris's pinned one-/eight-thread revision; the resulting medium-f32 MatMul gap is reproducibly ~17–21× versus ORT.


### 2026-07-20 — Vendored MLAS CPU-GEMM parity

Recorded approvals for the vendoring spike, corrected integration, and corrected multi-thread provenance (`556b0d8`, `85087ac`, `ee7a6cd`).


## 2026-07-20T13:35:00Z — Multistream performance and issue #40

- Reviewed issue #40 Phase-1 slices: 1a 🟡 approved with two non-blocking pressure follow-ups; 1b 🟢 approved after those fixes and full BufferOwnership/concurrency conformance audit.

- 2026-07-21: Scribe reconciled the perf campaign inbox; key decisions are now consolidated in `.squad/decisions.md` under the 2026-07-21 perf campaign section.

## 2026-07-21T05:40:00Z — fp16 decode and cross-platform reconciliation

- Revised CPU kernel tracing so bytes/FLOPs are computed only with an active span and the tracer dependency is optional; the reviewed combined work landed as `61f4d2c`.


## 2026-07-21 — Wave-2 and CI milestone
CI now covers all 27 offline crates with warnings-as-errors and native Windows ARM64. Capture-safe native fp16 CUDA decode wave 2 stacked GQA prep fusion, warp-shuffle RMSNorm, and specialized down-projection GEMV on wave 1, reaching 663–672 tok/s on H200 versus ORT GenAI at 657, with zero fallbacks. All CUDA EP kernel work must remain correct and fast across supported SM architectures, not only sm_90.

## 2026-07-21T11:15:00Z — CUDA EP Clippy gate
- Cleared all 21 CUDA EP Clippy warnings without allows, removed no-op drops of non-owning tensor views, and added blocking `-D warnings` Clippy to `cuda-compile`. Wallace approved; merged as `22ec87e`.
- 2026-07-21T23:55Z — WP4 and DS-1 rejection lockouts recorded; DS-1 was revised by Holden and approved by Pris, while WP4 is with Batty.
## 2026-07-22T12:00:00Z — Qwen2.5-7B CUDA-graph benchmark
- Measured Qwen2.5-7B int4 on H200: CUDA graph auto-enable reached **231.73 tok/s** vs forced eager **180.50 tok/s** (**+28.4%**), token-exact with zero fallbacks and one captured segment.

## 2026-07-22T21-35-00Z — ORT CUDA attention review
Rejected Howie's ORT CUDA attention branch `7ff33496bda2` because `ONNX_GENAI_CUDA_ATTENTION` bypassed the typed `RuntimeConfig` registry. Named Deckard as reviser and locked Howie out of this artifact.

## 2026-07-23T14:55:00Z — Mobius PR #404 DSA review

- Reviewed Leon's PR #404 DSA correctness fixes green: INT64 TopK indices, target-dtype finite mask handling, and indexer schedule length were cleared.

## 2026-07-23T18:30:00Z — Phi on-device select review

- Reviewed Deckard's `CudaOnDeviceConstantSelect` LongRoPE lowering 🟢 APPROVE: true/false branch mapping is preserved, unequal-table zero-padding is guarded by the threshold/extent proof, lowering is conservative, and capture-safe `Where` is determinism-neutral. Re-ran CUDA gate: 201 passed / 0 failed.

## 2026-07-23T20:30:00Z — Native/ORT parity harness review
- 🟡 Approved Roy's harness: deployed Qwen artifacts meet its symmetric block-32 Q4 dequantization contract, and fixed-fixture goldens/oracle checks are sound.
- Future artifact expansion must guard or generalize the block size, zero-point, `g_idx`, and initializer-shape assumptions.
