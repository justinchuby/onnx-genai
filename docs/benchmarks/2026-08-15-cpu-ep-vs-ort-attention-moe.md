# CPU EP vs ONNX Runtime CPU: attention, the surrounding transforms, and MoE

**Date:** 2026-08-15
**Host:** AMD EPYC 9V74, 16C/32T, 1 NUMA node, shared L3 = 32 MiB per 16 CPUs,
AVX2 + FMA (no AVX-512), 125 GiB RAM. Linux.
**Comparand:** a real ONNX Runtime CPU session (ort-sys pins ORT 1.27.0, API 27)
in the same process, on the same graph, with the same thread count and the same
inputs.
**Harness:** [`scripts/ort_ab/`](../../scripts/ort_ab/README.md).

> **Synthetic data.** No trained weights. Only the dimensions come from public
> architecture configs; tensor contents are the harness's deterministic
> synthetic pattern, fed identically to both runtimes. See the harness README.

> **The host is shared and contended.** Same-shape absolute timings drifted by
> more than 4× between sessions. Every number below is a *paired, interleaved*
> `native/ORT` ratio measured within one run. Lower is better; `1.0` is parity.
> Brackets are the observed min–max of the per-trial ratios.

## Why ratios against ORT and not against our own previous kernel

A kernel that gets 8× faster can still be 3× slower than the runtime a user
would otherwise run. Kernel-vs-previous-kernel speedups are not evidence of
competitiveness, and every claim below is therefore stated as a ratio against a
real ORT session including node and session overhead.

## 1. GroupQueryAttention — decode

`com.microsoft::GroupQueryAttention`, single node, static shapes.
`base` = before the direct-present change, `new` = after.

| model | past | t | base | new |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| llama3-8b b1 | 511 | 1 | 1.18 | 1.88 |
| llama3-8b b1 | 511 | 8 | 4.61 | **3.44** |
| llama3-8b b1 | 511 | 16 | 2.27 | **1.20** |
| llama3-8b b1 | 2047 | 1 | 1.02 | 1.02 |
| llama3-8b b1 | 2047 | 8 | 1.38 | **0.71** |
| llama3-8b b1 | 2047 | 16 | 1.21 | **0.61** |
| llama3-8b b1 | 8191 | 1 | 1.67 | **1.06** |
| llama3-8b b1 | 8191 | 8 | 2.72 | **1.67** |
| llama3-8b b1 | 8191 | 16 | 2.31 | **1.57** |
| llama3-8b b4 | 2047 | 1 | 1.78 | **1.15** |
| llama3-8b b4 | 2047 | 8 | 4.39 | **2.92** |
| llama3-8b b4 | 2047 | 16 | 3.50 | **2.14** |
| phi3-mini-4k b1 | 2047 | 1 | 2.78 | **1.67** |
| phi3-mini-4k b1 | 2047 | 8 | 1.84 | **1.03** |
| phi3-mini-4k b1 | 2047 | 16 | 1.46 | **0.94** |
| phi3-mini-4k b1 | 8191 | 1 | 3.45 | **1.97** |
| phi3-mini-4k b1 | 8191 | 8 | 6.56 | **3.60** |
| phi3-mini-4k b1 | 8191 | 16 | 6.64 | **3.69** |
| phi3-mini-4k b4 | 2047 | 1 | 3.59 | **2.00** |
| phi3-mini-4k b4 | 2047 | 8 | 7.30 | **3.99** |
| phi3-mini-4k b4 | 2047 | 16 | 7.68 | **4.42** |
| qwen2.5-0.5b b1 | 2047 | 1 | 1.96 | **1.40** |
| qwen2.5-0.5b b1 | 2047 | 8 | 0.83 | **0.69** |
| qwen2.5-0.5b b1 | 2047 | 16 | 1.42 | **0.95** |

**Root cause fixed:** the present-KV tensors were materialised into a scratch
buffer and then copied into the graph outputs, so every decode step copied the
whole cache twice. Writing the appended KV straight into the `present_*`
bindings removes one full copy.

**Where we still lose:** wide-batch and many-head decode (phi3-mini b4, llama3
b4) remains 2×–4.4× behind. Short contexts (past 511) are dominated by fixed
per-run overhead.

## 2. MultiHeadAttention / SDPA — encoder and cross-attention

| model | t | ratio |
|---|--:|--:|
| bert-base b8 s128 | 1 | 5.22 |
| whisper cross s1500 | 1 | 1.27 |
| whisper cross s1500 | 8 | 2.82 |
| whisper cross s1500 | 16 | 2.85 |

MHA remains **3.6×–5.2× behind** at encoder shapes after vectorising the x86
`sdpa_f32` path. `InferenceSession` has **no ORT fallback**, so declining
assignment is not available as an honest escape hatch; the remaining gap is
addressed in §5.

## 3. The transforms that surround attention

Requirement: prove the attention wins are not time pushed into a neighbouring
node. Isolated single-node graphs, `base` = before, `new` = after vectorising
and parallelising `Softmax` and `RotaryEmbedding`.

### Softmax

| shape | t | base | new |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| bert-base b8 s128 (12288×128) | 1 | 13.44 | **1.50** |
| bert-base b8 s128 | 8 | 76.03 | **5.07** |
| bert-base b8 s128 | 16 | 124.01 | **9.28** |
| decode h32 kv1024 | 1 | 9.64 | **1.29** |
| decode h32 kv2048 | 1 | 15.68 | **1.39** |
| decode h32 kv4096 | 1 | 16.94 | **1.40** |
| decode h32 kv8192 | 1 | 17.91 | **1.42** |
| decode h32 kv8192 | 8 | 71.10 | **6.39** |
| decode h32 kv8192 | 16 | 83.66 | **7.89** |
| prefill h32 s512 | 1 | 12.92 | **2.54** |
| prefill h32 s512 | 8 | 56.37 | **5.87** |
| whisper cross (30000×1500) | 1 | 11.09 | **2.10** |
| whisper cross | 8 | 41.66 | **6.05** |

### RotaryEmbedding

| shape | t | base | new |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| llama3 s128 | 1 | 22.48 | **2.53** |
| llama3 s128 | 8 | 72.41 | **10.51** |
| llama3 s512 | 1 | 29.44 | **6.11** |
| llama3 s512 | 8 | 55.58 | **6.38** |
| llama3 s512 | 16 | 61.36 | **9.95** |
| llama3 b8 s1 (decode) | 1 | 10.54 | **5.22** |
| llama3 b1 s1 (decode) | 1 | 10.08 | 8.99 |

**Root causes fixed:** scalar libm `exp` per element; fully serial loops (the
diagnostic is that the gap *grew* with thread count — ORT parallelizes, we did
not); and a full-tensor scratch buffer that was zeroed, filled and copied into
the output. RoPE additionally branched on tensor layout inside its innermost
loop.

Removing the scratch buffer mattered more than the vectorization for RoPE alone
(2.247 ms → 0.571 ms on one cell).

### Controls (graphs with no Softmax/RoPE node — must not move)

| model | t | base | new |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| GQA decode p2047 | 1 / 8 / 16 | 1.04 / 0.72 / 0.82 | 0.97 / 0.56 / 0.67 |
| MHA whisper cross | 1 / 8 / 16 | 1.27 / 2.82 / 2.85 | 1.26 / 2.76 / 2.81 |
| GQA prefill q512 | 1 / 8 / 16 | 2.22 / 4.05 / 3.24 | 2.42 / 3.85 / 3.72 |

All within dispersion.

### Measured but not fixed

| op | t=1 | t=8 | t=16 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| Transpose BSNH→BNSH (bert / whisper / llama3) | 13.8–24.8 | 55–78 | 68–121 |
| KV-cache `Concat` (llama3 p1023…p8191) | 1.9–12.7 | 0.6–12.8 | 2.0–28 |

These are generic tensor ops rather than attention kernels and were deliberately
left out of scope. They are a real, quantified gap.

## 4. Mixture of Experts

`com.microsoft::MoE`, single node, top-k routing, grouped experts.
`base` = before, `fixed` = after removing the per-call expert-weight copy.

| config | tokens | t | base | fixed |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| mixtral h1024 i3584 e8 | 1 | 8 | 20.62 | **0.73** |
| mixtral h1024 i3584 e8 | 1 | 16 | 21.90 | **0.71** |
| mixtral h1024 i3584 e8 | 32 | 8 | 52.84 | **1.43** |
| mixtral h1024 i3584 e8 | 32 | 16 | 56.14 | **1.22** |
| mixtral h1024 i3584 e8 | 512 | 8 | 9.56 | **1.62** |
| mixtral h1024 i3584 e8 | 512 | 16 | 7.87 | **1.59** |
| phi3.5-moe h2048 i6400 e4 | 1 | 8 | 12.32 | **0.98** |
| phi3.5-moe h2048 i6400 e4 | 1 | 16 | 15.93 | **0.78** |
| phi3.5-moe h2048 i6400 e4 | 32 | 8 | 21.74 | **0.88** |
| phi3.5-moe h2048 i6400 e4 | 32 | 16 | 13.26 | **0.65** |
| phi3.5-moe h2048 i6400 e4 | 512 | 8 | 2.57 | **0.82** |
| phi3.5-moe h2048 i6400 e4 | 512 | 16 | 3.36 | **0.86** |
| qwen3-moe h2048 i768 e16 | 1 | 8 | 24.87 | **1.74** |
| qwen3-moe h2048 i768 e16 | 1 | 16 | 24.10 | **1.56** |
| qwen3-moe h2048 i768 e16 | 32 | 8 | 38.27 | **2.37** |
| qwen3-moe h2048 i768 e16 | 32 | 16 | 16.34 | **1.47** |
| qwen3-moe h2048 i768 e16 | 512 | 8 | 4.05 | **1.56** |
| qwen3-moe h2048 i768 e16 | 512 | 16 | 6.14 | **1.53** |

**Root cause fixed:** every forward pass transposed the full expert weight bank
and `into_owned()`-copied it, so a decode step costing microseconds of arithmetic
first copied hundreds of MiB.

**Where we win:** phi3.5-moe at every measured point (0.65–0.98), mixtral decode
(0.71–0.73).
**Where we still lose:** all qwen3-moe cells (1.47–2.37) — 16 experts × top-8
is many small GEMMs, where ORT's grouped path amortises better — and mixtral
prefill (1.22–1.62).

## 5. The residual gap is dominated by per-run output allocation

Graph outputs are freshly allocated from the system allocator every run
(`CpuExecutionProvider::allocate` → `HostAllocator`). Internal values *are*
reused. glibc `mmap`s allocations ≥128 KiB, so those pages re-fault on every
run.

Evidence:

* A `[1,1,4096]` RoPE — 16 KiB in, 16 KiB out, a few thousand multiply-adds —
  still takes **67 µs**.
* GQA decode p2047 at t=1: **4.914 ms** end-to-end vs **3.62 ms** measured
  in-kernel, i.e. ~26% of wall time outside the kernel.

**An EP-level scratch arena for graph outputs is worth more than any further
kernel work on these ops.** This is the single highest-value remaining item.

## 6. GQA fusion gate: cache-topology sweep

The KV-group-fused decode path is opt-in behind a minimum-attended-KV-bytes
gate. The gate was originally a flat 8 MiB calibrated on one host. Sweeping the
per-head working set against L3:

| per-head working set | t=1 | t=4 | t=8 | t=16 | t=32 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 1 MiB | off 0.90 / **on 1.35** | 1.57 / 1.75 | 1.04 / 0.98 | 0.67 / 0.75 | 1.54 / 1.61 |
| 2 MiB | 1.00 / **0.81** | 0.73 / 1.48 | 1.24 / **1.06** | 1.36 / 1.37 | 0.80 / 1.07 |
| 4 MiB | 0.98 / **0.89** | 0.87 / 0.97 | 0.78 / **0.73** | 0.61 / 0.74 | 0.84 / 0.99 |
| 8 MiB | 1.05 / **0.98** | 1.03 / **1.02** | 1.50 / **1.37** | 1.53 / **1.26** | — |
| 16 MiB | 1.00 / **0.91** | 1.14 / **0.86** | 1.23 / **1.06** | 1.29 / 1.41 | 1.22 / 1.32 |
| 32 MiB | 0.90 / **0.79** | 1.17 / **0.79** | 1.28 / **0.90** | 1.15 / 1.11 | 1.15 / 1.11 |

The fused path is directionally better at and above 8 MiB and mixed below it.
The gate is therefore expressed topology-relatively as
`max(last_level_cache_bytes / fused_tasks, 8 MiB)`, with the 8 MiB floor — not
the topology model — being what makes it safe, and an unreadable-sysfs sentinel
that collapses to the floor. It remains **opt-in**: no general superiority is
claimed, and the 1–4 MiB crossover is unresolved below the ±9% dispersion.

## Validation

* Parity (`parity=PASS`) recorded on **every** cell in every table above, before
  and after each change.
* Bit-exactness or ≤1e-6 absolute agreement against independent scalar oracles
  for every rewritten kernel, across both layouts, both rotation modes, full and
  partial rotary, and sizes either side of each parallel threshold.
* Fully-masked (`-inf`) rows are pinned to reproduce ORT's NaN rather than being
  silently "fixed".
* Aliased output bindings (output over input buffer) are covered per kernel.

## Honest limitations

1. One host, one microarchitecture. AVX2 without AVX-512; no ARM measurements.
2. Synthetic tensor contents; production geometry only.
3. Single-node graphs isolate the operator but overweight fixed session
   overhead at small sizes.
4. The host is contended; absolutes are not comparable across sessions.
5. MHA (3.6×–5.2×), qwen3-moe (1.47–2.37×), standalone `Transpose` and KV-cache
   `Concat` all remain behind ORT and are not fixed here.
